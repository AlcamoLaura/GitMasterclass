# Git: From Zero to Hero - How to contribute

In the context of Git and open-source code, a **contribution** typically refers to any meaningful addition, modification, or improvement made to a project's source code by a collaborator or contributor. Contributions can take various forms, such as adding new *features*, *fixing bugs*, *optimizing code*, or *enhancing documentation*. These changes are usually submitted through a **version control system** like **Git**, often in the form of **Pull Requests** (**PR**). The collaborative nature of open source encourages developers from diverse backgrounds to share their expertise and collectively advance the quality and functionality of a project through their contributions. Effective collaboration and the transparent tracking of contributions are essential aspects of the open-source development model, allowing for community-driven innovation and continuous improvement.
