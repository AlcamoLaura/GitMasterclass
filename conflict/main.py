    You should agree with you colleague on writing two different simple algorithm. In this way,
    you will be sure that both of you write different code that will generate merging conflicts.
    
    Here are some suggestions:
    
        - Reverse a String.
          Description: write a program that takes a string as input and outputs the reverse of that string. This algorithm involves using a loop to iterate through the characters of the string in reverse order.

        - Factorial Calculation.
          Description: implement a function to calculate the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a non-negative integer is the product of all positive integers up to that number. This algorithm requires a loop and basic arithmetic operations.

        - Palindrome Checker.
          Description: create a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. Students can use if-statements and loops to compare characters from the beginning and end of the string.

        - Sum of Digits.
          Description: Write a function to calculate the sum of the digits of a given positive integer. This algorithm involves using a loop to iterate through the digits and adding them up.

        - Guess the Number Game.
          Description: develop a simple number guessing game where the program randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it. Provide hints such as "too high" or "too low" after each guess. This algorithm involves random number generation, user input, and conditional statements.
